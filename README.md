# Braintree-AMD.js

This is a fork of the Braintree.js script that's a pure AMD implementation. The next major release of Braintree.js plans to take AMD into account at which point I'll discontinue this fork.

In addition to making this pure AMD, I'll also plan on it having jquery passed as a dependency.

In our case this script will be included with our main require script, though you could call it as necessary.

See the [Braintree.js](https://github.com/braintree/braintree.js) for more information on the core of this script.
